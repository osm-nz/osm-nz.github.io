The Koordinates system has no way of creating a permalink to a specific feature, only to a specific location.

Contacted Koordinates tech support, and they said they'd consider this feature request.
Until then, this is just a super simple front-end page to proxy LDS data.

Thanks to [JOSM/tag2link](https://github.com/JOSM/tag2link), we have hyperlinks to go from the `OSM feature` → `?address_id=1234` → `LDS`.
